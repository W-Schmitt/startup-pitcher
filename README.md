# Startup Pitcher
For when you need inspiration when starting a start-up.

## What it is

It really is just a small random sentence generator based off of the words in `resources.json`, for the laughs.

I did a little bit of CSS just because, which allowed me to get a little bit back into it because I didn't do any CSS in a huge while.

Feel free to contribute if you want to add something! See [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/sayabiws/startup-pitcher/CONTRIBUTING.md).

## What it isn't

An actual idea machine. Please do not try any of the offered start-up ideas for your own company. Or do, I don't care, I won't take the responsibility for it.
